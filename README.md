## 1. Wing Calculator  
Estimate the required oscillation frequency for flight (wings) or swimming (fins) based on limb/fin length.  
This tool implements a scaling law derived from comparative biomechanics studies.

## 2. Hypergeometric Distribution Calculator  
Perform hypergeometric probability calculations for statistical overlap analysis.  
This is particularly useful in bioinformatics applications such as evaluating overlap between gene-expression signatures.

## 3. Graph Degree Calculator  
Visualize graphs and compute node degrees (in/out degree for directed graphs, degree for undirected graphs).  
Users can interactively add nodes and edges, toggle between directed/undirected modes, and view degree statistics in real time.
